          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            In 2022, fueled by an unwavering passion for justice and an
            unyielding commitment to fairness, Raquel and Justine embarked on a
            transformative journey. Together, they founded Vitalis Staffing,
            driven by a shared mission to address the pressing issues of pay
            inequality, lack of flexibility, and mistreatment faced by medical
            professionals. Today, our hearts beat with determination as we
            extend our fight, united in our unwavering dedication to empower
            nurses across California and create a future where justice, respect,
            and equity reign. Join us on this heartfelt journey as we champion
            your rights, stand tall in solidarity, and work hand in hand to
            build a stronger, more compassionate, and truly equitable healthcare
            system.
